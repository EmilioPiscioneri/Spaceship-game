# Spaceship-game
 A python game using pgame. Just small project, learning python.

 ## Known bugs/limitations
 - The hitbox of the player spaceship increases when travelling in diagional direction. It is like an axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB)
 - You can go out of the map when going into the right wall by going right and then stopping. You can leave tho. This can be done by adding padding of 1 pixel.
